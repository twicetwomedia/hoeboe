## Description

Easily update WordPress transients in the background via AJAX to increase site speed and avoid long page load times. Hoeboe can be especially helpful with caching of large external API calls or heavy internal database queries.

If you've used the WordPress Transients API, you already know how useful it can be with caching, page load, and site speed. If you've used transients to store data from external API calls or from heavy internal database queries, then you also know a few of its limitations. Namely, page load can be negatively impacted on the user session where a large transient gets updated.

Hoeboe helps to solve this problem of the one-off user who has to deal with potentially long page load while your site refreshes a transient in the background. With Hoeboe, you can choose to update those large transients in the background via AJAX. Your users won't notice anything different - other than possibly faster overall site speed.
